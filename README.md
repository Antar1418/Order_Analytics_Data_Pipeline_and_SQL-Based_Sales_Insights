                                  **Project Title:**
**Order Analytics Data Pipeline and SQL-Based Sales Insights**

Key Highlights:

1. Designed and automated a data cleaning pipeline using Python (Pandas) for order analytics, handling missing values, column standardization, and datetime parsing.

2. Validated data integrity through unique value checks and standardized column naming (lowercase, underscores) to ensure SQL compatibility and consistency.

3. Performed feature engineering by dynamically calculating profit from sale and cost price; optimized dataset by removing redundant columns to enhance memory efficiency.

4. Transformed raw datasets into analysis-ready formats, significantly improving reporting speed and data usability for business insights.

5. Leveraged SQL to extract critical sales metrics: Top 10 highest revenue-generating products, Top 5 highest-selling products by region, and Month-over-Month (MoM) growth comparisons for 2022 and 2023.

6. Conducted time-series and category analysis to identify peak sales months per category and the highest sub-category growth by profit year-over-year (YoY).

**Tools: Python (Pandas), SQL**

**Impact:** Enabled faster, more reliable reporting and empowered strategic decision-making through cleaner, optimized datasets and actionable sales insights.
